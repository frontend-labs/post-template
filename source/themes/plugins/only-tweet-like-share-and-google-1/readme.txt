A very simple yet one of the most extensively used social share plugin with vertical scrolling sharebar support.

== Description ==
A very simple social share plugin with just 5 social icons. Well the around 99% of the posts are share with these 5 social icons (i.e Twitter, FB Like, Google +1, Linkedin and FB Share) then why to have more. Lesser social icons means less load on pages and you pages will load much faster. Earlier there were just 4 icons. But upon the request of many of this plugin user I decided to add the Linkedin button.

Features of the plugin

*   Vertical scrolling sharebar support
*   Huge list of options to easily display the buttons where require
*   Support for `shortcode` to display anywhere inside your post/page
*   Display using function call (useful if you want to embed the code directly to your theme)

Facebook no longer supports the Share button so I had to remove the button. Well there is still a way to display the Share button. [Have a look at this post](http://techxt.com/plugin-support-forum/tweet-like-plusone-and-share-plugin/display-facebook-share-button-custom-button/)
